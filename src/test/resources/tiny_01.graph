%  tiny_01.graph
%  A very small example of an unweighted graph
%  stored in the METIS graph file format.
%
%  The first non-comment line lists 
%  the number of vertices (7) and edges (11).
%
%  The next line notes that vertex 1 is connected to vertices 5, 3 and 2.
%  Subsequent lines list the neighbors of successive vertices.
%
%  Notice that each edge is listed twice.  There are 11 edges,
%  but 22 edge entries.

%
%  Here begins the list of vertex neighbors for each vertex:
%
 5  3  2
 1  3  4
 5  4  2  1
 2  3  6  7
 1  3  6
 5  4  7
 6  4
